#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
void new(){
    int a;
    long b;
    char c;
    float d;
    double e;
    scanf("%d %ld %c %f %lf",&a,&b,&c,&d,&e);
    printf("%d\n",a);
    printf("%ld\n",b);
    printf("%c\n",c);
    printf("%.3f\n",d);
    printf("%.9f\n",e);
    
    
}
int main() {
new();
    /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT */
